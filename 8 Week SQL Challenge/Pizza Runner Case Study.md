### Business Use Case
Pizza Runner is a startup delivering pizza through freelance runners using a custom-built mobile app. Danny, the founder, wants to analyze customer orders, runner logistics, and pizza customizations to improve delivery efficiency, understand customer preferences, and refine the menu. He has collected data on orders, runners, and ingredients and needs SQL queries to generate insights and build simple datasets for better business decisions.

### Questions & Solutions

For each question, I have included a SQL Query Solution, its output, and a brief response to the information requested.  
  
**‚û°Ô∏è Data Cleaning and Manipulation ‚¨ÖÔ∏è**  
Prior to beginning the analysis and answering any questions, there are two tables that need some work done! Below it can be seen that the first table that needs to be cleaned is the *customer_orders* table:

<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/893f9af0-d1d9-4184-8f3e-36a09030dddf">
</p>
  
From the screenshot, we can see that there are blank spaces as well as null values in both the *exclusions* and the *extras* columns, which needs to be standardized. For that, I created a temporary table from the original *customer_orders* table and replaced any blank or non-standard values in the two aforementioned columns with NULL:
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 

  CASE
    WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(exclusions) = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE exclusions
  END AS exclusions,

  CASE
    WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(extras) = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE extras
  END AS extras,

  order_time

FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
The second table that needs to be cleaned is the *runner_orders* table. It displays the same issue as the previous table, with blank spaces and null values in the same column, which were all replaced with NULL for standardization. On that table, the data types in the *pickup_time*, *distance*, and *duration* columns must also be altered:


<p align="center" width="100%">
    <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8722e1c2-fd3e-4ad4-a629-80ec9267bc38">
</p>

For that, a similar approach was used:
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  

  CASE
    WHEN pickup_time ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(pickup_time) = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE pickup_time
  END AS pickup_time,

  CASE
    WHEN distance ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(distance) = '' THEN NULL
    WHEN distance LIKE '%km%' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(distance, 'km', ''))
    ELSE distance
  END AS distance,

  CASE
    WHEN duration ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(duration) = '' THEN NULL
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes%' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minutes', ''))
    WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'minute', ''))
    WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM(REPLACE(duration, 'mins', ''))
    ELSE duration
  END AS duration,

  CASE
    WHEN cancellation ILIKE 'null' OR TRIM(cancellation) = '' THEN NULL
    ELSE cancellation
  END AS cancellation

FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;
```
These temp tables will be used for the queries answering the case questions.

### Business Recommendations
Based on the conducted queries in response to the requests, there are a few observations that can be done from resulting outputs. For example, Danny's Diner can optimize operations by looking at customer spending patterns and tailoring its rewards program accordingly. Ramen stands out as the most popular item both by purchase frequency as well as preference among customers, making it a key product to promote and enhance brand image. Additionally, it appears that the rewards loyalty program provided by the Diner has the potential to influence customer behavior, especially during the first week of membership when purchases are incentivized by providing double points. This period could be leveraged to further drive customer engagement and encourage higher spending.  
  
To maximize the Diner‚Äôs profitability, some policies could be brainstormed for future implementation based on these insights. For example, offering bundle promotions on popular combinations like ramen paired with sushi or curry could encourage larger orders while catering to existing preferences. Also, targeted promotions for new members during their first week ‚Äî such as offering extra points on purchases above a certain threshold ‚Äî could drive higher initial spending and loyalty. These are just a few simple ideas gathered from the small dataset and resulting outputs that would naturally be expanded and better discussed were the dataset larger and more detailed over time.
