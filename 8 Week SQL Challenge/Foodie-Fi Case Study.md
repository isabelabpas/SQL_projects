### Business Use Case
Danny‚Äôs Diner is a small restaurant serving sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny wants to use customer data to understand their buying patterns, how much they spend, and which menu items are most popular. This will help improve the customer experience and decide whether to expand the loyalty program. Danny has provided sample data on sales, menu, and members and needs SQL queries to analyze this data and create simple datasets for his team to review.

### Business Recommendations
Based on the conducted queries in response to the requests, there are a few observations that can be done from resulting outputs. For example, Danny's Diner can optimize operations by looking at customer spending patterns and tailoring its rewards program accordingly. Ramen stands out as the most popular item both by purchase frequency as well as preference among customers, making it a key product to promote and enhance brand image. Additionally, it appears that the rewards loyalty program provided by the Diner has the potential to influence customer behavior, especially during the first week of membership when purchases are incentivized by providing double points. This period could be leveraged to further drive customer engagement and encourage higher spending.  
  
To maximize the Diner‚Äôs profitability, some policies could be brainstormed for future implementation based on these insights. For example, offering bundle promotions on popular combinations like ramen paired with sushi or curry could encourage larger orders while catering to existing preferences. Also, targeted promotions for new members during their first week ‚Äî such as offering extra points on purchases above a certain threshold ‚Äî could drive higher initial spending and loyalty. These are just a few simple ideas gathered from the small dataset and resulting outputs that would naturally be expanded and better discussed were the dataset larger and more detailed over time.
