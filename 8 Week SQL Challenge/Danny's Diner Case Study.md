### Business Use Case
Danny‚Äôs Diner is a small restaurant serving sushi, curry, and ramen. Danny wants to use customer data to understand their buying patterns, how much they spend, and which menu items are most popular. This will help improve the customer experience and decide whether to expand the loyalty program. Danny has provided sample data on sales, menu, and members and needs SQL queries to analyze this data and create simple datasets for his team to review.
