# From Queries to Clarity ðŸŒ”
Iâ€™ve recently started diving into SQL and Iâ€™m enjoying the challenge of working with databases. While my background is strong in data analytics tools, SQL has been a great way to build a more hands-on understanding of data manipulation and querying. Here you can find some SQL projects in the works.

â€¢ ðŸ¥¢ [Danny's Diner Case Study](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/): Still ðŸš§ in progress, but, in this project, I used SQL to help Dannyâ€™s Diner analyze customer purchasing patterns, spending habits, and favourite menu items. By querying sales, menu, and member data, I answered key business questions and provided insights to help improve the customer experience and expand their loyalty program.
