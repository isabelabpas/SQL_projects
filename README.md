# From Queries to Clarity 🌔
I’ve recently started diving into SQL and I’m enjoying the challenge of working with databases. While my background is strong in data analytics tools, SQL has been a great way to build a more hands-on understanding of data manipulation and querying. Here you can find some SQL projects in the works.

• 🥢 [Danny's Diner Case Study](https://github.com/isabelabpas/SQL_projects/blob/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge/Danny's%20Diner%20Case%20Study.md): In this project, I used SQL to help fictional Danny’s Diner analyze customer purchasing patterns, spending habits, and favourite menu items. By querying sales, menu, and member data, I answered key business questions and provided insights to help improve the customer experience and expand their loyalty program.  
  
• 🍕 [Pizza Runner Case Study](https://github.com/isabelabpas/SQL_projects/blob/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge/Pizza%20Runner%20Case%20Study.md): In this project, I used SQL to analyze data for the fictional Pizza Runner delivery service. By querying customer orders, runner activity, and ingredient preferences, I answered key business questions related to order volume, delivery performance, pizza customization, and operational costs. The insights helped uncover trends in customer behavior, ingredient usage, and runner efficiency.
